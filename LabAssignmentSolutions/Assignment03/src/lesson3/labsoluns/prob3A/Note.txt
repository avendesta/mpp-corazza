Does it make sense to use inheritance here?

 - No, it doesn't make sense to use inheritance. First a Circle is barely a type of a Cylinder,
   a circle is 2D object (its meaningless to talk about volume of 2D objects) 
   while Cylinder is 3D, and zero height cylinder is not the definition of a circle
   
   
   It's also not useful to use inheritance when the two classes have only few things in common. 
   there might come another class, which the circle class may extend, like ClosedCurve class, and
   java only allows single inheritance
