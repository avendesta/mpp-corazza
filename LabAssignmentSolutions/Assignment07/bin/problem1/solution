1A. ArrayList implements Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, List<E>, RandomAccess
    ArrayList inherits java.util.AbstractList<E>

1B. The equals method being used in `contains` inside the method 'listsAreEqual' is the one inherited from Object
    not the one defined their.

1C. The containsKey in removeDuplicates compares keys by their hashCode. but here the default
    hashCode is being used, because its not overriden. With the default hashCode, any two
    objects have different hashcode no matter their attribute values, and therefore containsKeys
    always returns false;

1D. HashMap is used to track duplicates and equals and hashCode have been
    implemented correctly in Employee. However, values in the HashMap are modified 
    while it is updated, leading to incorrect results (violating principle that keys should be immutable)

1Ei. When D is a class and A, B, C are interfaces:
	if either B.method() or C.method() is a default method, 
	then D has to override method() or declare it abstract if D is abstract
        
    When D is an interface,
	if either B.method() or C.method() is default method,
	then D has to override method()
